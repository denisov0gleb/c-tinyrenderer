# c-tinyrender

A simple realization of image render written on ANSI C.
The main idea is based on [tinyrender](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) tutorial.

All used non-standard libraries are written by myself:
* [ppmImageLib](https://github.com/denisov0gleb/ppmImageLib) - [denisov0gleb](https://github.com/denisov0gleb)


## Built With

* [GNU-make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) - Makefile works fine on machines with GCC (for Linux or Mingw-64 for Windows).
